# 🛠️ Installation

> This guide provides instructions for installing and setting up the Telegram Bot SDK

## 🔍 Requirements {#requirements}

- 🐘 PHP 8.0 and higher
- 🔑 Telegram Bot Token - Talk to [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) and generate one.
- 🧰 Laravel 9 and higher (Optional)

### 🔑 Obtaining Telegram Bot Token {#obtaining-telegram-bot-token}

1. Open the Telegram app and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).
2. Follow the instructions to create a new bot.
3. After creating the bot, the "BotFather" bot will give you a bot token. Keep this token safe, as you will need it to use the Telegram Bot API.

:::tip
Your **bot token** is its unique identifier – store it in a secure place, and avoid sharing with anyone or publishing your bot token anywhere. Everyone who has your token will have full control over your bot.
