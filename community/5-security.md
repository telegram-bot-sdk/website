# Security Policy

We take security very seriously. We follow the rule of [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure), and we
encourage the community to as well.

## Supported Versions {#supported-versions}

After each new major release, the previous release will be supported for no less than 6 months, unless explicitly stated otherwise. This may mean there are multiple supported versions at any given time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability {#reporting-vulnerability}

If you discover a security vulnerability within this package, please email Syed at `security at telegram-bot-sdk.com`. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed. Please do not disclose security-related issues publicly until a fix has been announced.
